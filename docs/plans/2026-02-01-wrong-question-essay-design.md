# Design: Wrong-Question / Right-Answer Meta Essay

## Goal
Write a 2500+ word Chinese meta-essay based on the idea “nothing is more dangerous than a correct answer to the wrong question.” The stance is strongly cautionary, aimed at academic/philosophical readers, with mixed-domain real cases (science, public policy, education).

## Audience & Tone
- Audience: Academic/philosophical readers
- Tone: Serious, reflective, warning-oriented; clear and concise Chinese style
- Style: Short paragraphs, strong logical flow, minimal jargon

## Structure
1. Title + abstract/lead
2. Introduction: define “wrong question” and why correct answers can be more dangerous than wrong answers
3. Mechanism: why correct answers amplify wrong framing (authority, resources, incentives, institutional lock-in)
4. Case studies (mixed domains):
   - Science: streetlight effect (observational bias)
   - Public policy/war metrics: McNamara fallacy + body count metric in Vietnam
   - Education governance: NCLB testing and curriculum narrowing, Campbell’s law
5. Methodology: problem-framing checklist and safeguards (value/goal/measurement, boundary checks, counter-metrics, reversible pilots)
6. Conclusion: epistemic humility, institutional responsibility
